## Background

I completed the Level 1 homework with the Associate Profit Splitter. This smart contract will allow you to split a payment amongst three employees. Using the constructor function allows this to be used like a template where different addresses can be swapped in should the employees change. I was able to successfully deploy this contract to the Kovan test network and provided screenshots showing the deployment.
